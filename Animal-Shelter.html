      <li>Gorilla</li>
      <p> This is Nebuchadnezzar, the gorilla. The best damn gorilla you have ever seen in your life. Probably the only gorilla you've ever seen in your life. Dress it up in a tux and take it to all your fancy parties. You know you want to. </p>
      <img src="img/bobcat.jpg" alt="A photo of a bobcat." width="800" height="600">
      <li>Bobcat</li>
      <p> This is Cilantro, the bobcat. Cilantro is playful, hates children, and is the most venomous feline alive. But loves to snuggle.</p>
      <img src="img/blue-dragon.jpg" alt="A photo of a blue dragon." width="800" height="600">
      <li>Blue dragon</li>
      <p> This is Blue, the dragon. Blue is a cold, freezing dragon that may freeze you if you get anywhere near it. If this occurs, rename yourself as Popsicle.</p>
    </ul>
